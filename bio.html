				<h1>About Me</h1>
        <div class="w3-container">
          <h5>I grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina, where I've wanted to pursue Computer Science since taking it freshman year of high school. My senior year, my teacher decided to move the curriculum to Machine Learning, where he taught us concepts like Naive Bayes and k-NN clustering. These fascinated me, and I began exploring them on my own time. The summer after my freshman year at Penn State, I wrote a basic convolutional model with Python and NumPy. This project helped me get a position as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at PSU, where I've had the oppurtunity to work on some very cool projects and papers. Aside from my experience with Machine Learning, one of my favorite parts of college so far have been my experience as my fraternity's Philanthropy Chair. As the chair, I raised over $10,000 across multiple events that have benefitted organizations ranging from the PAWS Dog Shelter to the Women's Center of Centre County.</h5> 
          <h5>As a student here at PSU, I've really enjoyed classes such as Computer Vision, High Performance Computing, and Artificial Intelligence that let me explore new concepts through code. Since being introduced to Machine Learning by a high school computer science teacher, I've been captivated by the ability to program a model that can actually learn as it goes. Some of my favorite projects I've worked on here are implementing the t-SNE algorithm in CUDA & C++, combining four object detecting methods into one script, and creating a text generation script using Markov Models. I've written code in C, C++, Python, Matlab, CUDA, and more while using programming paradigms like dynamic programming to design effienct algorithms. Working on projects in a group have taught me the basics of Git and good team communication, while personal projects helped sharpen my design and debugging skills. </h5>
